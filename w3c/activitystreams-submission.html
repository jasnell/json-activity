<h2 id="rfc.section.1">1. Introduction</h2>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">
  In the most basic sense, an "activity" is a semantic description of 
  potential or completed actions. In the former case, the activity expresses 
  what can be done with a particular object, while in the latter case, it 
  expresses what has already been done.  
</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">
  It is the goal of this specification to provide a JSON-based syntax that 
  is sufficient to express metadata about activities in a rich, human-friendly, 
  machine-processable and extensible manner. This may include constructing 
  natural-language descriptions or visual representations about the activity, 
  associating actionable information with various types of objects, 
  communicating or recording activity logs, or delegation of potential actions 
  to other applications.  
</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
  "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
  interpreted as described in <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.  
</p>

<h3 id="rfc.section.1.1">1.1. Relationship to JSON Activity Streams 1.0</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">
  The <a href="#activitystreams-1.0">JSON Activity Streams 1.0</a> 
  specification was published 
  in May of 2011 and provided a baseline extensible syntax for the expression 
  of completed activities. This specification builds upon that initial 
  foundation by incorporating lessons learned through extensive implementation, 
  community feedback and related work being performed in other standards 
  development communities.  
</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">
  While the syntax defined by this specification diverges somewhat from that 
  defined by JSON Activity Streams 1.0, the verbs, objectTypes, extensions and 
  fundamental model defined by that original specification remain intact.  
</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">
  Refer to <a href="#deprecated-syntax">Section 6</a> for more detail about 
  the differences between the 1.0 and 2.0 syntax and for a listing of specific 
  backwards compatibility requirements.  
</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">
  This specification incorporates several existing extensions to the 1.0 syntax 
  directly into the 2.0 model. These include portions of the 
  <a href="#base-schema">Activity Streams 1.0 Base Schema</a> 
  , <a href="#audience">Audience 
  Targeting</a> , 
  <a href="#responses">Responses</a> , 
  and <a href="#priority">Priority</a> 
  extensions. 
</p>

<h3 id="rfc.section.1.2">1.2. Relationship to JSON-LD 1.0</h3>

<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">
  The <a href="#W3C.WD-json-ld-20130411">JSON-based Serialization for Linked 
  Data (JSON-LD)</a> 
  describes a rich syntax for the serialization of semantically-rich metadata 
  using the JSON format.  While the updated Activity Streams representation 
  provided by this document is not defined as a "JSON-LD Vocabulary", the 
  syntax is designed to be closely compatible with JSON-LD.  
</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">
  There are a few differences between JSON-LD and the serialization syntax 
  described here, specifically: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    JSON-LD uses certain field names with a leading "@" character, such as 
    "@id" and "@language". In this specification, the leading "@" is omitted.  
  </li>
  <li>
    While JSON-LD allows using relative IRI references in the values of "id" 
    properties, this specification limits identifiers to absolute IRIs. 
  </li>
  <li>
    While it is possible to derive a JSON-LD "@context" description for the 
    Activity Streams 2.0 JSON syntax one is not normatively provided by this 
    specification.  
  </li>
</ul>

<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3">
  When processing an Activity Streams document as JSON-LD, the following 
  rules apply: 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The "objectType" property MUST be treated as an alias of JSON-LD "@type".  </li>
  <li>The "id" property MUST be treated as an alias of JSON-LD "@id".  </li>
  <li>The "language" property MUST be treated as an alias of JSON-LD "@language".  </li>
  <li>A JSON array used to convey <a href="#link">Link</a> values MUST be treated as an unordered JSON-LD @set (@container = @set).  </li>
  <li>The JSON array value for the "items" property defined in <a href="#collection">Section 3.7</a> MUST be treated as an ordered JSON-LD @list (@container = @list).  </li>
  <li>The "displayName", "title", "content" and "summary" properties defined in <a href="#object">Section 3.1</a> and <a href="#object-ext">Section 3.6</a> MUST be treated as JSON-LD Language Maps (@container = @language).  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rfc.section.1.3">1.3. Syntax Conventions</h3>
  
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.1">
  This specification defines a <a href="#RFC4627">JSON-based</a> 
  serialization syntax.  
</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.2">
  When serialized, absent properties are represented by either (a) setting the 
  property value to null, or (b) by omitting the property declaration altogether 
  at the option of the publisher; these representations are semantically 
  equivalent. If a property has an array value, the absence of any items in 
  that array MUST be represented by omitting the property entirely or by 
  setting the value to null. 
</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.3">
  This specification uses IRIs <a href="#RFC3987">[RFC3987]</a>.  Every URI 
  <a href="#RFC3986">[RFC3986]</a> is also an IRI, so a URI may be used wherever 
  an IRI is named.  There are two special considerations: (1) when an IRI that 
  is not also a URI is given for dereferencing, it MUST be mapped to a URI 
  using the steps in Section 3.1 of <a href="#RFC3987">[RFC3987]</a> and 
  (2) when an IRI is serving as an "id" value, it MUST NOT be so mapped.  
</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.4">
  Unless otherwise specified, all properties with date and time values MUST 
  conform to the "date-time" production in <a href="#RFC3339">[RFC3339]</a>, 
  with an uppercase "T" character used to separate date and time, and an 
  uppercase "Z" character in the absence of a numeric time zone offset. All 
  such timestamps SHOULD be represented relative to Coordinated Universal 
  Time (UTC).  
</p>



<h2 id="rfc.section.2">2. Example Activities</h2>

<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">Following are three examples of activities with varying degrees of detail.  </p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.2.1">2.1. Example 1: Minimal Activity</h3>

When represented as a String, the use of relative references other than a simple name is not allowed. When represented as an Object, the "id" property MUST be specified.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">Within the Activity Streams 2.0, Type values are used only by the "objectType" and "verb" properties.  </p>
<p>Object type as a simple name (isegment-nz-nc):</p>

<p>Object type as an absolute IRI:</p>

<p>Object type as an object:</p>

      "displayName": "Person"
    },
    "displayName": "John"

</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">Because the second and third examples above each specify "http://example.org/Person", the two examples are considered to specify the same type.  </p>

    "verb": "post",
    "actor": "acct:john.doe@example.org",
    "object": "http://example.org/123"

<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.4">Allowing verbs and object types to be represented as objects rather than simple names or IRIs is intended to simplify the use of extensions that an implementation might not have encountered previously. The object properties provide additional information and metadata about the new verb or object type.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.5">It is important to note that because the "id" property is strictly limited to absolute IRI values, the object representation cannot be used to describe types with simple names.  </p>
  <h3 id="rfc.section.3.4"><a id="link"/>3.4. Link Values</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.1">Link values represent references to other objects and resources.  They are expressed as either: (1) a String containing an absolute or relative IRI, (2) an <a href="#object">Object</a> , or (3) a JSON Array containing a mixture of IRIs or <a href="#object">Objects</a> . Link values are closely related to the conceptual model of Links as established in <a href="#RFC5988">[RFC5988]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.2">For example, as defined previously, all <a href="#object">objects</a> can contain an "image" property whose value describes a graphical representation of the containing object. This property will typically be used to provide the URL to a JPEG, GIF or PNG type resource that can be displayed to the user. Any given object might have multiple such visual representations -- multiple screenshots, for instance, or the same image at different resolutions. Using Link values, there are essentially three ways of describing such references.  </p>
<p>To reference a single image without any additional metadata, the link value can be expressed as a simple JSON string containing an absolute or relative IRI:</p>
<pre>
  {
    "objectType": "application",
    "id": "http://example.org/application/123",
    "displayName": "My Application",
    "image": "http://example.org/application/123.png"
  }
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, if additional metadata is required, the link can be expressed as an object containing the url property.</p>
<pre>
  {
    "objectType": "application",
    "id": "http://example.org/application/123",
    "displayName": "My Application",
    "image": {
      "url": "http://example.org/application/123.png",
      "mediaType": "image/png",
      "height": 320,
      "width": 320
    }
  }
</pre>
<p>If more than one link value is to be expressed, A JSON Array with a mix of string and object elements can be used:</p>
<pre>
  {
    "objectType": "application",
    "id": "http://example.org/application/123",
    "displayName": "My Application",
    "image": [
      "http://example.org/application/abc.gif",
      {
        "url": "http://example.org/application/123.png",
        "mediaType": "image/png",
        "height": 320,
        "width": 320
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.3">Individual items contained in such an array are independent of the others and no significance is given to the ordering of those items.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.4">RFC 5988 defines that all Links have a "link relation" that describes the contextual purpose of the link. Within an <a href="#object">object</a> , in the absence of a specific "rel" property within the link object itself, the name of the property whose value is a link serves as the "link relation".  Any valid link relation value, as defined by RFC 5988, can be used as a property with a link value in any Activity Streams object, except where the link relation might conflict with any other property defined by this specification.  </p>
<p>In the following example, two separate links are provided. The link relation of the first is "image", while the link relation of the second is "preview". Both links, however, can be used as alternative visual representations of the "application" object.</p>
<pre>
  {
    "objectType": "application",
    "image": [
      "http://example.org/foo.jpg",
      {

<h4 id="rfc.section.3.5.1">3.5.1. Considerations on the use of "priority"</h4>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.1">The presence of the "priority" property does not impose any specific processing or display requirements on the part of any entity consuming the activity.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.2">Expressing the value as a range of numeric decimal values is intended to provide the greatest level of flexibility in the expression and consumption of prioritization detail.  It is expected that implementors consuming activity objects containing "priority" will utilize and expose the additional information in a number of different ways depending on the unique requirements of each application use case.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.3">Many existing systems do not represent priority values as numeric ranges.  Such systems might use fixed, labeled brackets such as "low", "normal" and "high" or "urgent".  Similar mechanisms can be established, by convention, when using the "priority" property.  In typical use, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations wishing to work with such defined categories treat "priority" property values in the range 0.00 to 0.25 as "low" priority; values greater than 0.25 to 0.75 as "normal" priority; and values greater than 0.75 to 1.00 as "high" priority.  Specific implementations are free to establish alternative conventions for the grouping of priority values with the caveat that such conventions likely will not be understood by all implementations.  </p>
<h4 id="rfc.section.3.5.2"><a id="audience-targeting"/>3.5.2. Audience Targeting Properties</h4>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.1">Every Activity has both a Primary and Secondary audience. The Primary audience consists of those entities either directly involved in the performance of the activity or who "own" the objects involved. The Secondary audience consists of the collection of entities sharing an interest in the activity but who are not directly involved (e.g. "followers").  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.2">For instance, suppose a social network of three individuals: Bob, Joe and Jane. Bob and Joe are each friends with Jane but not friends with one another. Bob has chosen to "follow" activities for which Jane is directly involved. Jane shares a file with Joe.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.3">In this example, Jane and Joe are each directly involved in the file sharing activity and together make up the Primary Audience for that event. Bob, having an interest in activities involving Jane, is the Secondary Audience. Knowing this, a system that produces or consumes the activity can intelligently notify each person of the event.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.4">While there are means, based on the verb, actor, object and target of the activity, to infer the primary audience for many types of activities, those do not work in every case and do not provide a means of identifying the secondary audience. The "to", "cc", "bto" and "bcc" properties MAY be used within an Activity to explicitly identify the Primary and Secondary audiences.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.5">The prototypical use case for an Activity containing these properties is the publication and redistribution of Activities through an intermediary. That is, an event source generates the activity and publishes it to the intermediary which determines a subset of events to display to specific individual users or groups. Such a determination can be made, in part, by identifying the Primary and Secondary Audiences for each activity.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.6">When the event source generates the activity and specifies values for the to and cc fields, the intermediary SHOULD redistribute that event with the values of those fields intact, allowing any processor to see who the activity has been targeted to. This is precisely the same model used by the to and cc fields in email systems.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.7">There are situations, however, in which disclosing the identity of specific members of the audience may be inappropriate. For instance, a user may not wish to let other users know that they are interested in various topics, individuals or types of events.  To support this option, an event source generating an activity MAY use the "bto" and "bcc" properties to list entities to whom the activity should be privately targeted. When an intermediary receives an activity containing these properties, it MUST remove those values prior to redistributing the activity. The intent is that systems MUST consider entities listed within the "bto" and "bcc" properties as part of the Primary and Second audience but MUST NOT disclose that fact to any other party.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.8">Audience targeting information included within an Activity only describes the intent of the activity creator. With clear exception given to the appropriate handling of "bto" and "bcc", this specification leaves it up to implementations to determine how the audience targeting information is used.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">The JSON syntax defined by this specification differs somewhat from that defined in the original <a href="#activitystreams-1.0">JSON Activity Streams 1.0</a> specification in ways that are not backwards compatible. Implementations can choose to continue supporting the JSON Activity Streams 1.0 syntax but SHOULD consider it to be deprecated. This means that while implementations MAY continue to consume the 1.0 syntax, they SHOULD NOT output the 1.0 syntax unless specifically interacting with older non-2.0 compliant implementations.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">Specifically: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Implementations MUST use the "application/stream+json" MIME media type when producing a JSON serialization of an Activity Object conforming to the 1.0 syntax, and "application/activity+json" when producing a serialization conforming to the 2.0 syntax.  </li>
  <li>Implementations that process serializations of an Activity Object identified using either the "application/stream+json" or the more generic "application/json" MIME media type MUST follow the syntax and processing rules set by <a href="#activitystreams-1.0">[activitystreams-1.0]</a>. The 2.0 syntax and processing rules apply only when handling serializations using the "application/activity+json" media type.  </li>
  <li>This document redefines the "displayName", "title", "content" and "summary" properties as <a href="#lang">Natural Language values</a> , which means their values can be expressed as either a String or a JSON-LD Language Map. In the 1.0 syntax, these are expressed solely as String values. Because the 1.0 values are a valid subset allowed by this specification, implementations are not required to take any specific action to continue supporting those values.  </li>
  <li>This document redefines a large number of common properties defined originally as Objects in 1.0 as <a href="#link">Link values</a> . This means the property values can be expressed as either an IRI String, an Object, or an Array of IRI Strings and Objects. Because the 1.0 values are a valid subset allowed by this specification, implementations are not required to take any specific action to continue supporting those values.  </li>
  <li>This specification replaces the "upstreamDuplicates" and "downstreamDuplicates" properties defined in the 1.0 syntax with a singular "duplicates" property with a <a href="#link">Link value</a> . The "upstreamDuplicates" and "downstreamDuplicates" property values in 1.0 are defined as Arrays of strings. Implementations MUST consider the union of these two values as an alias for the "duplicates" property.  </li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.3">By following these requirements, all JSON Activity Streams 1.0 serializations can be processed successfully by 2.0 implementations.  </p>
  <h2 id="rfc.section.7">7. Comparison of Identifier Values</h2>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">The values of "id" properties can be compared to determine if the identifiers represent duplicate content. The values MUST be compared on a character-by-character, case-sensitive basis.  Comparisons MUST be based solely on the character strings themselves and MUST NOT rely on dereferencing the IRIs or URIs mapped from them.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">As a consequence, two IRIs that resolve to the same resource but are not character-for-character identical will be considered different for the purposes of identifier comparison. In such cases, the "duplicates" property can be used to expressly relate such objects to one another.  </p>
  <h2 id="rfc.section.8">8. Extensibility</h2>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">Processors that encounter unfamiliar properties within any Activity Streams object MUST NOT stop processing or signal an error and MUST continue processing the items as if those properties were not present.  </p>
  <h2 id="rfc.section.9">9. Security Considerations</h2>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">Publishers or Consumers implementing Activity Streams as a stream of public data may also want to consider the potential for unsolicited commercial or malicious content and should take preventative measures to recognize such content and either identify it or not include it in their implementations.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">Publishers should take reasonable measures to ensure potentially malicious user input such as cross-site scripting attacks are not included in the Activity Streams data they publish.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">Consumers that re-emit ingested content to end-users MUST take reasonable measures if emitting ingested content to make sure potentially malicious ingested input is not re-emitted.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.4">Consumers that re-emit ingested content for crawling by search engines should take reasonable measures to limit any use of their site as a Search Engine Optimization loophole.

<h2 id="rfc.appendix.B">Appendix B. Processing as JSON-LD</h2>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">While the Activity Streams 2.0 syntax is designed to be compatible with JSON-LD, in order to successfully process an Activity Streams document as JSON-LD, a "@context" description needs to be provided.  The following example illustrates an Activity Streams document that can be processed as JSON-LD containing Schema.org defined metadata elements.  </p>
<pre>
  {
    "@context": {
      "@vocab": "http://activitystrea.ms/spec/2.0/",
      "verb": "@type",
      "objectType": "@type",
      "id": "@id",
      "actor": "http://schema.org/Action/performedBy",
      "object": "http://schema.org/BuyAction/bought",
      "purchase": "http://schema.org/BuyAction",
      "person": "http://schema.org/Person",
      "book": "http://schema.org/Book"
    },
    "verb" : "purchase",
    "id" : "urn:example:purchase:123/abc",
    "displayName": "John purchased 'A Tale of Two Cities'",
    "startTime" : "2013-04-02T12:31Z",
    "endTime" : "2013-04-02T12:31Z",
    "actor": {
      "objectType": "person",
      "displayName": "John Doe"
    },
    "object": {
      "objectType": "book",
      "displayName": "A Tale of Two Cities"
    }
  }
</pre>
<h2 id="rfc.appendix.C">Appendix C. Motivational Use Cases</h2>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.1">This specification defines a number of syntax changes relative to the JSON Activity Streams 1.0 specification. The sections that follow describe some of the general motivations for these changes with illustrative examples.  </p>
<h3 id="rfc.appendix.C.1">C.1. Internationalization (i18n)</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.C.1.p.1">The JSON Activity Streams 1.0 syntax has no inherent notion of a "language context". That is, the core syntax has no internal mechanism a publisher can use to identify the language used when constructing the Activity Streams document. Nor are there any existing mechanisms at the JSON syntax level that an Activity Streams implementation can inherit. This specification introduces the "language" property and Natural Language Value concepts to fill this gap.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.1.p.2">Imagine a scenario with a service that receives Activity objects from users and republishes those to a distributed audience of interested parties. This service spans international boundaries and the users speak a multitude of different languages. Within this system, a native English speaker might subscribe to notifications about activities posted by a native French speaker.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.1.p.3">For instance, let's suppose that our native French speaker posts the following activity to this system: </p>
<pre>
  POST /activity/feed HTTP/1.1
  Content-Type: application/activity+xml
  
  {
    "verb": "post",
    "language": "fr",
    "object": {
      "objectType": "article",
      "displayName": "Un exemple basique",
      ...
    }
  }
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.C.1.p.4">The system receives this activity post and prepares to notify our native English speaking user. Knowing that this user prefers English and does not speak a word of French, the system can inspect the Activity and detect automatically that a translation ought to be provided. Rather than replacing the original French text, however, the service can simply add in the English translation along side it.  </p>
<pre>
  {
    "verb": "post",
    "language": "fr",
    "actor": {
      "id": "urn:example:person:abc",
      "displayName": "Jean Valjean"
    },
    "object": {
      "type": "article",
      "displayName": {
        "fr": "Un exemple basique",
        "en": "A basic example"
      }
      ...
    }
  }
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.C.1.p.5">It is also possible for a Natural Language Value to express alternative same-language representations of a string that utilize different writing systems or regions. For instance, it is common for Japanese translations to provide equivalent ideographic (kanji) and phonetic (katakana or hiragana) alternatives: </p>
<pre>
  {
    "title": {
      "ja-Hani": "...",
      "ja-Kana": "..."
    }
  }
</pre>
<h3 id="rfc.appendix.C.2">C.2. Extensibility (e11y)</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.p.1">Arguably, the two most important extensibility points in the Activity Streams format are the object type and verb properties. Implementations are free to come up with their own types and verbs at any point. While such extensibility is extremely powerful, it comes with a cost. Namely, implementations that encounter previously unknown verbs and object types may not have enough to knowledge about those to do anything significant with them.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.p.2">For instance, the most common use case for Activity Streams today is the generation of a human-readable "activity feed" that translates Activity objects into sentences just as "John uploaded a new photo" or "Jane checked in at a hotel", etc. Given an extension verb such as "http://example.org/whatever", an implementation might not have sufficient information about that verb to generate a readable sentence describing the activity that occurred.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.p.3">With Activity Streams 1.0, a number of different approaches have been tried to address this problem, but all of the solutions essentially deal with the need to provide additional metadata about extension verbs and object types so that an implementation can dynamically learn and adapt. The notion of "type values" is added by this specification to specifically deal with this issue.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.p.4">For example, suppose I have an implementation that generates Activity objects that use a new extension verb "urn:example:verbs:upload". Knowing that consumers of these objects might not have encountered this verb before, I want to make it possible for those implementations to automatically discover metadata about the new verb. To do so, I can use a type value to provide some basic information.  </p>
<pre>
  {
    "verb": {
      "id": "urn:example:verbs:upload",
      "url": "http://example.org/verbs.json",
      "mediaType": "application/ld+json",
      "displayName": {
        "en": "upload",
        "fr": "televersement"
      },
      "alias": "post"
    },
    "actor": {
      "type": "person",
      "displayName": "John"
    },
    "object": {
      "type": "photo",
      "displayName": "cats.jpg"
    }
  }
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.p.5">An implementation receiving this has several choices. It could choose to ignore everything other than the verb's identifier, treating it generically as one would have to today using the 1.0 syntax; or, it could inspect the metadata provided and notice that the extension verb can be treated generally as an alias of "post" or displayed in English as "upload" and in French as "televersement"; or, it can choose to attempt discovering more information about the verb by dereferencing the provided URL.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.p.6">The point is, these options are built into the core syntax, making extension verbs and object types significantly more usable, particularly when combined with the new language context features.  </p>
<h3 id="rfc.appendix.C.2.1">C.2.1. Publishing Extension objectType and verb Libraries</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.1.p.1">By treating extension objectTypes and verbs as objects in their own right, it becomes trivially possible to use the Activity Streams format as a means of publishing metadata about extension verbs.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.1.p.2">For example:</p>
<pre>
  {
    "displayName": "My object types and verbs",
    "items": [
      {
        "objectType": "verb",
        "id": "urn:example:verbs:create",
        "alias": "post",
        "displayName": "Create"
      },
      {
        "objectType": "objectType",
        "id": "urn:example:types:article",
        "displayName": "Article"
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.C.2.1.p.3">Implementations could use such documents to dynamically learn about new verbs and objectTypes.  </p>
<h3 id="rfc.appendix.C.3">C.3. First Class Links</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.C.3.p.1">Linking in the 1.0 syntax is largely undefined and inconsistent.  There is a general notion of Media Link objects that are used for some things like images and videos, along with a "url" property that in some cases is used to always point to HTML represenations while in other cases might point to JSON documents or image files, and there is no reusable concept of a generic link provided for extensions to leverage which has led to inconsistent implementation.  The 2.0 syntax introduced here deals with these issues by introducing a clear, consistent, reusable first class linking model.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.3.p.2">For instance, using the 2.0 syntax, an "image" object type can be represented simply as: </p>
<pre>
  {
    "objectType": "image",
    "url": "http://example.org/cats.jpg",
    "mediaType": "image/jpeg",
    "displayName": "A picture of my cats",
    "alternate": {
      "url": "http://example.org/gallery?i=cats.jpg",
      "mediaType": "text/html"
    }
    "preview": "http://example.org/thumbnails/cats.jpg"
  }
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.C.3.p.3">Essentially, any 2.0 object that contains a "url" property can be interpreted as a link. That "url" property points to a representation of the object, while the "mediaType" property identifies the content type of that linked resource. RFC 5988 Link Relations can be used directly within the 2.0 syntax to provide additional data -- in this case, an alternative HTML representation of the image as well as a thumbnail preview.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.3.p.4">Another case that the more flexible linking approach allows us to address is providing multiple links for a single property.  For instance, it is not uncommon for there to be several alternative versions of an image resource offered at various resolutions to support multiple types of devices. With the 2.0 syntax, multiple choices for a single link can be easily provided.  </p>
<pre>
  {
    "objectType": "application",
    "displayName": "My application",
    "icon": [
      {
        "url": "http://example.org/sd/icon.png",
        "width": 57,
        "height": 57
      },
      {
        "url": "http://example.org/hd/icon.png",
        "width": 114,
        "height": 114
      }
    ],
    "preview": [
      "http://www.example.org/screenshots/1.jpg",
      "http://www.example.org/screenshots/2.jpg",
      "http://www.example.org/screenshots/3.jpg"
    ]
  }  
</pre>
<h3 id="rfc.appendix.C.4">C.4. Use of External Vocabularies</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.C.4.p.1">Use of an "external vocabulary" within Activity Streams means using object types, verbs and properties that are not defined by the core Activity Streams specification. An example would be using concepts defined within a microdata vocabulary such as that defined by Schema.org (http://schema.org).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.4.p.2">Implementations that wish to use a Activity Streams with such external vocabularies face the challenge that, often times, identical or overlapping concepts can be expressed in a multitude of ways depending on which vocabulary is selected. This can make it difficult to map abstract data models into a specific JSON serialization.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.4.p.3">For instance, suppose an application uses the Schema.org model to represent an article, described here: http://schema.org/Article.  Within this model, there are several properties defined that directly overlap properties defined by the core Activity Streams syntax.  Such properties include "name", "contentLocation", and "articleBody". In order to encode the abstact model of a Schema.org/Article into the JSON Activity Streams model, the application needs to determine precisely how to map the abstract properties to the serialized format. In Activity Streams 1.0, no guidance was given on how to achieve such a mapping, within the 2.0 syntax, the JSON Serialization for Linked Data (JSON-LD) provides a foundation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.4.p.4">Using JSON-LD I can maintain basic Activity Streams 2.0 syntax while mapping the physical serialization to the abstract model inline.  </p>
<pre>
  {
    "objectType": "article",
    "displayName": "My article about things",
    "content": "This is my article",
    "@context": {
      "objectType": "@type",
      "article": "http://schema.org/Article",
      "displayName": "http://schema.org/name",
      "content": "http://schema.org/Article/articleBody"
    }
  }  
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.C.4.p.5">For any non-JSON-LD aware implementation, this can be processed just as if it were an ordinary Activity Streams object, without any additional consideration given. For a JSON-Ld aware implementation, however, the addition of the "@context" property allows the serialized JSON to be unambiguously mapped to the Schema.org concept of an "Article". The fact that we can support such a mapping allows the Activity Streams format to extend to a broader range of scenarios without requiring alternative, incompatible vocabulary specific models of "actions" or "activities" to be developed.  </p>
<h3 id="rfc.appendix.C.5">C.5. Embedded Actions</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.C.5.p.1">Every Activity Streams object represents a discreet modular component that can be distributed, shared, or acted upon in a variety of ways. The 2.0 syntax allows these components to not only express information about the content but also about the specific types of actions that can be performed with the object.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.5.p.2">For example, an email that is automatically generated by an expense reporting system could embed a structured Activity Stream object that contains a listing of the possible actions the recipient of the email can take. An intelligent email agent can interpret this embedded metadata and provide a tailored, in-context UI experience: </p>
<pre>
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;script type="application/activity+json"&gt;
        {
          "objectType": "expense-report",
          "url": "url": "https://example.org/view?id=abc123",
          "description": "John's trip to San Francisco",
          "actions": {
            "approve": "https://example.org/approve?id=abc123",
            "reject": "https://example.org/reject?id=abc123"
          }
        }
  &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Your employee, John Doe, has submitted a new expense 
      report for "John's trip to San Francisco"....
    &lt;/body&gt;
